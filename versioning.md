There really is no reason to look any futher than [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0][semver].

In broad terms, SEMVER advocates dividing the version tag into three parts: ``MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH``. The scope of an update to the production code should be reflected in the delta between the previous and new version. E.g. a bug fix will generally correspond to a software patch and would be indicated with ``X.X.X -> X.X.X+1``.

## Helpful tools

[Bumpversion][bumpversion] is a nice tool to automate the process of updating the version of your software. It's written in Python but is otherwise language agnostic.

For a general Python project the basic configuration file would reside in the root of the project and look something like this:

{% highlight INI %}
[bumpversion]
current_version = 0.0.1
commit = True
tag = True

[bumpversion:file:my_package/VERSION]
{% endhighlight %}
